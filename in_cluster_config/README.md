This directory tests the `default` Service Account for Pod scheduled into edge nodes managed by kubeedge.
## Test `default` Service Account.

### First time
1. run the test script:
	```bash
	MASTER_IP=sedna-mini-control-plane NS=llh bash k8s-in-cluster-config.sh
	```
	this script will create a namespace for testing:
	- rolebinding for viewing k8s resource permission.
	- A job named access-api testing the default token,  it will be scheduled into edge nodes.

1. Get the pod's nodeName
	```bash
	kubectl get -n llh pod -o wide
	```
1. Open another terminal tab, login the edge node, see the pod log using `docker logs <pod_container_id>`, you will see:
	```txt
I0913 07:52:15.448795       1 k8s-in-cluster.go:51] Get 1 pods successfully
	```

### Second time
Delete the `access-api` job by `kubectl -n llh delete job access-api`, do the commands in the first time again.

But in the logs command, you will see this instead:

	```txt
E0913 09:16:49.148799       1 k8s-in-cluster.go:49] Failed to get pods: Unauthorized
	```

## clean it:
```bash
NS=llh bash k8s-in-cluster-config.sh clean
```
